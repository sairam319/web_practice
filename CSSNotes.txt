CSS -- Cascading style sheets are used to apply styles of HTML pages.

There are 3 ways to do styling 

1)INLINE -- By using the style attibute in HTML element like as below.

<h1 style="color:red">WILL</h1>

2)Internal -- Internal styling is applicable only to the particular web page and it is declared like as of below.

<html>
<head>
<title>WILL ON WHELLS</title>
<style> // This is how styling applied to multiple h1 tags by declaring as of below , 
h1{
    color: red
}
body{
    background-color:green
}
</style>
</head>

NOTE:-
====

INLINE styling overrides the Internal styling

for example like below.
<html>
<head>
<title>WILL ON WHELLS</title>
<style> // This is how styling applied to multiple h1 tags by declaring as of below
h1{
    color: red
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>WILLONWHEELS</h1> // for this tag color red will be applied
<h1 style="color:Orange">WILLONWHEELS</h1> // for this text color orange is  applicable as Inline overrides the Internal styling.

3)External:

          In External styling a separate file with  .css format will be created  and our requirements are  specified as of below
,specifically External stylesheeting helps in apply the same style for any number of web pages.

body{
    background-color:orange;   // once .css file was created and all requirements were specified we must establish a connectivity between
                                     .css and HTML and that can be done in below format
}


below as one sample HTML format
<html>
<head>
<title>WILLONWHEELS</title>
<link rel = "stylesheet" href=".css"/>
</head>

NOTE:-
     Inline stylesheets overrides Internal stylesheets
     Internal stylesheets overrides External stylesheets

=========================================---ID concept------==============================================================
 there are multiple elements with same styling and if we want to differentiate them we have to create an id to that specific tag element
 then use that id for styling like as below.

 <html>
 <head>
 <title>WILLONWHEELS</title>
 <style>
 h1{
    color:blue
 }
 #text1{                      // here we referencing the tag with an id,best practice is to use unique id for any element.
    color:brown
 }
 </style>
 </head>
 </html>
 <body>
 <h1>some text</h1>
 <h1 id="text1">some text 2</h1>
</body>
 =======================================----Class------=============================================================================


 <head>
 <title>WILLONWHEELS</title>
 <style>
 h1{
    color:blue
 }
 #text1{                     
    color:brown
 }
 h1.cls{                    //we have to  call out class with its name as stated here
    
 }
 </style>
 </head>
 </html>
 <body>
 <h1>some text</h1>
 <h1 class="cls">some text</h1>
 <h1 class="cls">some text</h1>
 <h1 class="cls">some text</h1>
 <h1>some text</h1>
 <h1>some text</h1>
 <h1>some text</h1>
 <h1>some text</h1>
 <h1 id="text1">some text 2</h1>
</body>
